# Challenges Faced



1. Main Model and Query Response Pipeline 

   The most difficult and ongoing challenge is forming the complete working pipeline: generating embeddings, storing and retrieving vectors, and accurately answering queries using the model. The functions in `utils.py` are complex and have not yet stabilized for all elements in the database.



2. Vector Store Implementation

   Initially tried using ChromaDB but faced compatibility and technical issues. After switching to FAISS, it worked more reliably, but the transition required substantial changes in embedding storage and retrieval logic.



3. Understanding Dataset Columns

   Interpreting the dataset column headers took considerable time due to inconsistent naming and unclear data types. Once the columns were mapped correctly, the dataset merging was straightforward.



4. Hugging Face Token Integration  

   Integrating the Hugging Face model and setting up the token took time. Proper handling of authentication, managing rate limits, and ensuring optimal memory usage were crucial for smooth functionality.
